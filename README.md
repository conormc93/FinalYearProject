# Introduction<a name = "intro"></a>
For our final year project, we wanted to look at Inventory Management Systems and how they work. We then wanted to create our own 
Inventory Management System Application. We chose this topic as Inventory Management Systems are important for every business. They let the business manage all their stock and orders and allows them to monitor how theyre company is operating. We developed an application that allows users to keep track of their customers, products and orders. We focused on these items as we felt they are the three main components that make up an Inventory Mangement System. We created a 3-tier application, using a MySQL database, a Java Spring Boot backend and an Angular application as our frontend.
